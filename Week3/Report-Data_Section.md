### Report: Data Section
To accomplish this project, we acquire datasets from many sourses:

1. [Foursquares API](https://foursquare.com/), where are scrape accurate location data of vanues for exploration.
2. [List of postal codes of Canada: M from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M), where we obtain the info about boroughs and neighborhoods of Toronto. This dataset will be converted into pandas dataframe and used for exploring neighborhoods around Toronto.
3. [NYC geo location data from IBM](https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset). Similarly, we will use this JSON file to load NYC boroughs/neighborhoods dataset and explore it.

These are all original datasets we collect online. As the project going through we will generate more datasets used for research. They will be mentioned and explicitly explained during the project.
