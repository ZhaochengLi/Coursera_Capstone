## Capstone Project Report
### On clustering and exploring the neighborhoods of *Toronto* and *New York city*
#### Name: Zhaocheng Li

### 1. Introduction
#### 1.1 Interests
Toronto and New York city are ones of most modern and international cities in the world, and their population and scales grow rapidly. They are all the economical capitals of their respective contries(CANADA/USA). However, the distance between them are suprisingly closer than most people think. It taks only an hour flight to arrive from one to another.

But, it is not common to have two world-class metropolises that are close to each other like Toronto and NYC, in terms of closegeographical distance. Which makes me wonder, is it possible for Toronto and NYC to have more similarities? The similarities/dissimilarities can be discussed in fields of population distribution, personal wealth distribution, shops distribution, and race distribution, etc..

#### 1.2 Business problems
Many business problems will rise after this problem. Once we understand the similarities/dissimilarities of neighborhoods of  Toronto & of NYC, we can reveal some very important characteristics such as multiculture(races/languages), population distribution and income per capital differential. The stakeholders can decide the optimized location for business based on these factors.
For example, if we want to open a chinese restaurant, we want to choose a location not just in a business district, but most importantly, a location with a high asian population, and maybe with big asian markets.
